Abstract.

\hp-adaptive finite element methods for continous and discontinuous Galerkin methods on distributed memory systems.

We present algorithms for the automatic identification of areas for adaptation and decision criterion to decide between \h- or \p-adaptation

We provide a reference implementation in the \dealii{}\footnote{\url{https://www.dealii.org}} library and apply it to the Laplace problem on a domain with a reentrant corner which invokes a singularity. With this example, we demonstrate the benefits of the \hp{}-adaptive methods and show that our algorithm scales up to 49,152 \texttt{MPI} processes.

Abstract.

We provide a reference implementation in the \dealii{}\footnote{\url{https://www.dealii.org}} library and apply it to the Laplace problem on a domain with a reentrant corner which invokes a singularity. With this example, we demonstrate the benefits of the \hp{}-adaptive methods and show that our algorithm scales up to 49,152 \texttt{MPI} processes.

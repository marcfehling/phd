Latex project for my dissertation.

Contains document and mindmap for ideas.

Work in progress.

Tentative title: Algorithms for massively parallel hp-adaptive finite element methods

Important things to consider:
<ul>
<li> Enable shell-escape
<li> Bibliography type is BibLaTex. Use `biber` as a parser.
<li> Generate document with `pdflatex`.
</ul>

Chapters finished:
- [ ] Introduction
- [X] Static parallel hp-adaptive methods
- [x] Dynamic parallel hp-adaptive methods
- [x] Application on Poisson's problem
- [ ] Summary

To indicate whetehr refinement or coarsening is going to happen by adding flags. Additionally, we want to set . Upon execution of refinement, the adaptation flags will we translated to \h-adaptation and all future fe indices will be considered as \p-adaptation.

But how do

Which finite element to pick on coarsened cells?

We found it to introduce so called \texttt{future fe indices} that determine the finite element that will be associated to its cell after refinement has happened.

We need to indicate which individual cell we will refine. Force p over h. Choose p over h.

This provides the basic functionality to \hp-adaptation on finite element data structures on distributed memory.

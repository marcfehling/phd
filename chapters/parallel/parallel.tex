Any kind of numerical method requires thorough thought on designing suitable algorithms and data structures with respect to correctness, robustness and performance. In general, the ideas behind implementations of these methods are similar and can be generalized.
%, especially when they are based on the same numerical method.
This is also the case for additional enhancements that improve basic realizations. In case of the \gls{fem} such features are, for example, parallelization, adaptive methods, continuous or discontinuous Galerkin methods, and the support for complex geometries.

In this chapter, we will present algorithms and data structures for parallel, \hp-adaptive \glsfmtlongpl{fem}. For now, we focus on static domains with a fixed grid resolution and assignment of finite elements that will not change during the course of the application. Those can be used for multi-physics applications, in which different characteristics can be assigned to certain parts of the domain using dedicated finite elements that couple with each other, for example, a Stokes fluid interacting with an elastic solid \textcite{dealiistep-46}.

Generalized thoughts on the following two aspects have already been presented: \textcite{bangerth2009} developed a general implementation for \hp-adaptive \gls{fem} software; and a generalized distributed computing approach of the \glsfmtlong{fem} has been introduced by \textcite{bangerth2012}. However, the consolidation of both features is not trivial, thus this chapter should be understood as an enhancement of the two aforementioned contributions and bases on large parts on it. For details, we recommend a previous reading of both articles, since only relevant key aspects are revised in the following.

We will elaborate on the non-trivial aspects of parallel, \hp-adaptive \gls{fem} in the following sections, after providing a brief overview about the basics that are necessary for their understanding. These non-trivial aspects are the unique enumeration of \glspl{dof} in the context of \gls{cg} methods, as well as load balancing. All features added to the \dealii{} library in the context of hp-adaptive \gls{fem} can be found in a development log provided here \textcite{dealiiissue3511}.
